# Sonar_Camera_Dataset-SCD-
This is a dataset collected from sonar+camera system

## 1. Introducation
A bioinspired sonar robot is built to collect data from indoor/outdoor environment. A GoPro camera system is mounted to this robot and triggered by the DAQ system. The dataset consits two parts. One is raw echo data from sonar, another is image data from camera. Research with coordinating audiual + virtual data can be developed based on this dataset.

### 1.1 Hardware
The sonar robot is built with one loudspeaker and two microphones. The Gopro camera is mount below the loudspeaker. 



### 1.2 Software
The DAQ system consists of Rasberry Pi and Arduino Due. Two ADC and one DAC channels. 




## 2. Properties
Sampling rate: 400 kHz per channel.

### 2.1 Audiual data
FM signal. 105 kHz to 20 kHz. 2 ms long.
### 2.2 Virtual data
RGB image. 800 x 600.
